-left off
-------------

-need to merge graphs better, incase a player is more than one cell

-i should make a render graph, then fill in the cells with each render pass
    -render the map first
    -then the enemies
    -then the player
    -then the effects
    --all the passes that are not the map need to be merged into a new graph before being culled
    -etc


-server sends data to build world, and players position.
-need to start updating that position on keypresses and letting the server know
-update other connected clients
-use buffers to render only what the camera sees.


----------
-make a single player campaign
-then attepmt to use similar logic for the online portion


---aed

left off, moving the gui to the rad.panels

save
 -to db
 -to cache
load
 -from db
 -from cache
both ascii and colors

input for graph dimensions
dropdown for graph dimensions

make default ascii palette
 -multiple versions
select ascii palettes
select to show "large palette"

dim graph lines

have a draw button
or, radio button for paint or draw
depending on mode, when clicking on palette graph allows use of that character
highlight when over
eventually export ascii values of unhidden strings, to make a faster more condensed graph for use
so that I can make custom graphs.

-------------
-the world needs to be destroyed when all players leave it

-server world should create the map
  -then villiages and stages in that map
  -the villages generate npc and enemies
  -all that data is saved to the world
-the local copy of the world, duplicates that data send to it from the server
  -also has buffer variables, and the camera so it knows how to draw all that data when it needs to

-look at hosting it somewhere as well. if on my home machine
-proxie the port
