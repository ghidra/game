-need to merge graphs better, incase a player is more than one cell
-errors checking so character cant leave the mpa, or rather, dont draw the character if he is outside, dont merge him
-set the camera to follow the player on the client side
-i should make a render graph, then fill in the cells with each render pass
    -render the map first
    -then the enemies
    -then the player
    -then the effects
    --all the passes that are not the map need to be merged into a new graph before being culled
    -etc


-server sends data to build world, and players position.
-need to start updating that position on keypresses and letting the server know
-update other connected clients
-use buffers to render only what the camera sees.

-------------
-the world needs to be destroyed when all players leave it

-server world should create the map
  -then villiages and stages in that map
  -the villages generate npc and enemies
  -all that data is saved to the world
-the local copy of the world, duplicates that data send to it from the server
  -also has buffer variables, and the camera so it knows how to draw all that data when it needs to

-look at hosting it somewhere as well. if on my home machine
-proxie the port
